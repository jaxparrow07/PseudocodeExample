# Pseudocode Example
Writing code/instructions of logic in human readable ( Basic English ) format which can be later understood by non-programmers. When reading it, you need to understand or imagine what it is actually going to do. Doesn't follow any strict syntax/way to write the instructions. 

### Suggestions to write Pseudocode

* Capitalize Key Commands ( **IF** number is > 10 **THEN** )
* Write one statement per line
* Use Indentation ( `TAB` Key if digitally )
* Be Specific
* Keep it simple and neat

### Sample Excercise
We're going to write a pseudocode instructions first. Simply, think of the instructions in basic English.

#### FizzBuzz
##### What we want to do
Write a program that prints the number from 1 to 20<br>
For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number<br>
For the multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of the number<br>
For numbers whiich are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"<br><br>
##### What we are going to do
Loop from 1 to 20. Stop and exit if it is 20. Check if the number is divisble by 3 ( If the remainder is 0 ) if yes, print "Fizz". Else if the number is divisble by 5, print "Buzz" instead. Else If the number is both divisble by 3 and 5 ( In this case of 1 to 20, 15 is the only number ). So, we will use it instead of indirectrly checking the number.
